\heading{One-way functions.}
Consider game $\gOW{\FF,\advA}(\secParam)$ of \figref{fig-ff-ow} associated to a function family $\FF$ and an adversary $\advA$.
The game runs $\Kg{\FF}$ to generate a function key $\FKey$.
It then samples a uniformly random input $x$ and computes $y = \Ev{\FF}(\secIn,\FKey,x)$.
The adversary $\advA$ takes $\FKey$ and $y$ as input, and its goal is to to produce any $x'$ such that $y = \Ev{\FF}(\secIn,\FKey,x')$.
\begin{defn}
  Let $\FF$ be a function family.
  For all adversaries $\advA$ and all $\secParam\in\N$, let $\owAdv{\FF,\advA}{\secParam}=\Pr[\gOW{\FF,\advA}(\secParam)]$ be the advantage of $\advA$ in breaking the one-wayness of $\FF$.
  We say that $\FF$ is one-way if $\owAdv{\FF,\advA}{\cdot}$ is negligible for all PT adversaries $\advA$.
\end{defn}

\heading{Input sampler.}
Let $\FF$ be a function family.
An input sampler $\sampS$ for $\FF$ is a PT algorithm that takes $\secIn$ and a function key $\FKey\in[\Kg{\FF}(\secIn)]$ to return $x\in\Dom{\FF}(\secParam,\FKey)$

\heading{Functions one-way with respect to an input sampler.}
Consider game $\gISOW{\FF,\advA}(\secParam)$ of \figref{fig-ff-isow} associated to a function family $\FF$, an adversary $\advA$, and an input sampler $\sampS$ for $\FF$.
First, the game runs $\Kg{\FF}$ to generate a function key $\FKey$.
It then runs $\sampS$ to sample an input $x$ from some distribution over $\Dom{\FF}(\secParam,\FKey)$, and computes $y=\Ev{\FF}(\secIn,\FKey,x)$.
The adversary $\advA$ takes $\FKey$ and $y$ as input, and has to find any $x'$ such that $y=\Ev{\FF}(\secIn,\FKey,x')$.
\begin{defn}
  Let $\FF$ be a function family.
  Let $\sampS$ be an input sampler for $\FF$.
  For all adversaries $\advA$ and all $\secParam\in\N$, let $\isowAdv{\FF,\advA}{\secParam}=\Pr[\gISOW{\FF,\advA}(\secParam)]$ be the advanatage of $\advA$ in breaking the one-wayness of $\FF$ for $\sampS$.
  We say that $\FF$ is one-way with respect to $\sampS$ if $\isowAdv{\FF,\advA,\sampS}{\cdot}$ is negligible for all PT $\advA$.
\end{defn}

\heading{Output sampler.}
Let $\FF$ be a function family.
An output sampler $\sampS$ for $\FF$ is a PT algorithm that takes $\secIn$ and a function key $\FKey\in[\Kg{\FF}(\secIn)]$ to return $y\in\Rng{\FF}(\secParam,\FKey)$

\heading{Functions one-way with respect to an output sampler.}
Consider game $\gOSOW{\FF,\advA}(\secParam)$ of \figref{fig-ff-osow} associated to a function family $\FF$, an adversary $\advA$, and an output sampler $\sampS$ for $\FF$.
The game starts by running $\Kg{\FF}$ to generate a function key $\FKey$.
It then runs $\sampS$ to sample an output $y$ from some distribution over $\Rng{\FF}(\secParam,\FKey)$.
The adversary $\advA$ takes $\FKey$ and $y$ as input, and has to find any $x'$ such that $y=\Ev{\FF}(\secIn,\FKey,x')$.
\begin{defn}
  Let $\FF$ be a function family.
  Let $\sampS$ be an output sampler for $\FF$.
  For all adversaries $\advA$ and all $\secParam\in\N$, let $\osowAdv{\FF,\advA}{\secParam}=\Pr[\gOSOW{\FF,\advA}(\secParam)]$ be the advanatage of $\advA$ in breaking the one-wayness of $\FF$ for $\sampS$.
  We say that $\FF$ is one-way with respect to $\sampS$ if $\osowAdv{\FF,\advA,\sampS}{\cdot}$ is negligible for all PT $\advA$.
\end{defn}

\iffalse
\heading{Extensions.}
Note that the definition of one-wayness with respect to a sampler could be changed to require that the sampler takes $\secIn$ and $\FKey\in[\Kg{\FF}(\secIn)]$ to directly produce an output $y\in\Rng{\FF}(\secParam, \FKey)$.
The security game would use it in place of the current instructions sampling $x$ and computing $y$.
However, this 
surjective (and hence bijective)

\heading{Multi-input sampler.}
Let $\FF$ be a function family.
A multi-input sampler $\sampS$ for $\FF$ specifies a PT algorithm $\run{\sampS}$ and a function $\vl{\sampS}\colon\N\to\N$.
Multi-input sampling algorithm takes $\secIn$ and a function key $\FKey\in[\Kg{\FF}(\secIn)]$ to return a vector of input values $\bx$ such that $\size{\bx} = \vl{\sampS}(\secParam)$ and $\bx[i]\in\Dom{\FF}(\secParam,\FKey)$ for all $\secParam\in\N$ and all $i\in[\vl{\sampS}(\secParam)]$.

\red{
One potential problem with the above is that it does not guarantee $\Dom{\FF}(\secParam,\key)$ can be sampled from efficiently.
So the existence of a OWF will then \emph{not} imply all the things we want it to (i.e. that a PRG exists).
Note that allowing a negligible probability of error/negligible statistical distance does not fix this.
}

Now a definition based on syntax 3:
\begin{defn}
	Let $\FF$ be an input-sampleable family of functions. Then the one-way advantage of any adversary $\advA$ against $\FF$ is defined as $\owAdv{\FF,\advA}{\secParam}=\Pr[\gOW{\FF,\advA}(\secParam)]$. $\FF$ is a one-way function iff for all PT adversaries $\advA$, the function $\owAdv{\FF,\advA}{\cdot}$ is negligible.
\end{defn}

We let $\setOW$ denote the set of all one-way functions.
